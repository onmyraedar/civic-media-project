[ ] Computer to run Deep Motion software\n\n### Steps:\n\n**Step 1: Capture video**\n\nConsider a cultural movement you feel is perhaps not reflected in popular media (games, videos, tv shows, movies, etc). For instance, it can be a cultural mannerism like moving your hands in a certain way to convey a certain mood or message. Or it could be a dance movement that is not commonly known.\n\n3. [ ] Take a picture of yourself looking directly at the camera\n4. [ ] Record a 10 seconds (or less) video of this movement or gesture. Be sure to take a full shot - your whole body.\n\n**Step 2: Prepare media for use**\n\nUpload on to your computer. If you are using a webcam this step will probably not be necessary.\n\n**Step 3: Upload into Deep Motion software**\n\nGo to DeepMotion online and use the software to create an avatar that will animate based on the video your recorded.\n\n5. Open DeepMotion software (deepmotion.com) and sign up for an account.\n6. Go to Animate 3D and hit Create.\n7. Use one of the default character OR use the ReadyPlayerMe character creation tool - and edit as you see fit. Note: you can upload the photo you took earlier to generate a base character to work from if you want.\n8. Name your character and you are done creating your character.\n9. Then click on create animation, and upload the video into the software. The video needs to have a resolution of 1920 x 1080 or lower, AND be less than 10 seconds. So you may have to edit the video.\n10. Upload your video into the software.\n11. Download the GLB file.\n\n**Step 4: Open the GLB file**\n\n1. Use gltf-viewer to open your GLB file. https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/\n\n**Step 5: Prepare a reflection statement.**\n\nIn 500 words or less, prepare a statement that addresses the following questions:\n\n- What was the most challenging aspect of this exercise?\n- What kind of cultural expressions did you attempt to capture?\n- What do you think are the limitations of these tools in terms of capturing embodied cultural expressions and movements?",

[ ] Computer to run Deep Motion software\n\n### Steps:\n\n**Step 1: Capture video**\n\nConsider a cultural movement you feel is perhaps not reflected in popular media (games, videos, tv shows, movies, etc). For instance, it can be a cultural mannerism like moving your hands in a certain way to convey a certain mood or message. Or it could be a dance movement that is not commonly known.\n\n3. [ ] Take a picture of yourself looking directly at the camera\n4. [ ] Record a 10 seconds (or less) video of this movement or gesture. Be sure to take a full shot - your whole body.\n\n**Step 2: Prepare media for use**\n\nUpload on to your computer. If you are using a webcam this step will probably not be necessary.\n\n**Step 3: Upload into Deep Motion software**\n\nGo to DeepMotion online and use the software to create an avatar that will animate based on the video your recorded.\n\n5. Open DeepMotion software (deepmotion.com) and sign up for an account.\n6. Go to Animate 3D and hit Create.\n7. Use one of the default character OR use the ReadyPlayerMe character creation tool - and edit as you see fit. Note: you can upload the photo you took earlier to generate a base character to work from if you want.\n8. Name your character and you are done creating your character.\n9. Then click on create animation, and upload the video into the software. The video needs to have a resolution of 1920 x 1080 or lower, AND be less than 10 seconds. So you may have to edit the video.\n10. Upload your video into the software.\n11. Download the GLB file.\n\n**Step 4: Open the GLB file**\n\n1. Use gltf-viewer to open your GLB file. https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/\n\n**Step 5: Prepare a reflection statement.**\n\nIn 500 words or less, prepare a statement that addresses the following questions:\n\n- What was the most challenging aspect of this exercise?\n- What kind of cultural expressions did you attempt to capture?\n- What do you think are the limitations of these tools in terms of capturing embodied cultural expressions and movements?",
